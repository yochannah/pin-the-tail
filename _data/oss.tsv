We're working on it because it's related to our research, so we figured it was worth the effort to go beyond just writing research code and make it more general. But it's in no one's job description and will be part of no one's dissertation.			"Determining if I'm paid / if others are paid for the project is hard. Currently, 6 of the 7 contributors are PhD students. I'm the only one currently planning on putting it in my dissertation (and hence I counted myself as being paid to work on it), but that might change.

I'm not planning on seeking funding, but I have an informal arrangement with my advisor for a post-defense job that will involve me working on this project."
